## 📊 Task 01: Population Visualization

**Goal:** Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables.  
**Dataset:** India's population distribution by age (2022).

**Key Highlights:**
- Plotted bar charts to represent population in age groups.
- Used Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
- Understood demographic composition through visual storytelling.

## 📈 Task 02: Titanic EDA

**Goal:** Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

**Key Highlights:**
- Handled missing data and outliers.
- Explored survival patterns based on age, class, and gender.
- Visualized relationships using heatmaps, box plots, and count plots.

## 🌳 Task 03: Decision Tree on Bank Marketing Data

**Goal:** Predict whether a customer will purchase a product using a decision tree classifier.

**Dataset:** UCI Bank Marketing dataset.

**Key Highlights:**
- Preprocessed categorical and numerical variables.
- Built and evaluated a Decision Tree model using `sklearn`.
- Analyzed key factors influencing customer behavior.

## 🚧 Task 04: Accident Data Pattern Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze traffic accident data to identify accident patterns.

**Dataset:** Accident dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or official traffic data portals).

**Key Highlights:**
- Identified patterns by road condition, weather, and time of day.
- Visualized accident hotspots and contributing factors.
- Used `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `geopandas` for visual analysis.
